Websocket:
---------
Persistent bidirectional full duplex connection b/w client and server.

once the websocket is setted up then client send send data to server or server can send data to client.

1. Statefull
2. bidirectional
3. Full-Duplex:
        data transmission can occur in both directions. both directions at same time as well


HTTP:
-----
1. Unidirectional: at a time either server can send data or client can send data.
                    bidirectional data transfer at a time is not possible

2. Stateless: 
    HTTP is considered stateless because each HTTP request made by a client to a server is independent of previous requests.

3. Half-Duplex:
    data transmission can occur in both directions, but only one direction at a time

How State Can Be Managed in HTTP
--------------------------------
Although HTTP is stateless, state management can be implemented on top of HTTP when needed:

Cookies: The server sends small pieces of data to the client, which the client stores and sends back with subsequent requests.
Sessions: The server assigns a session ID (usually stored as a cookie) to the client. The server then associates this ID with stored session data.
Tokens: In modern systems (e.g., REST APIs), tokens (like JWTs) are used to encode client state or authentication information and are sent with each request.
