Things to learn:
----------------
1. Node js event loop understanding. 

what is node js?
---------------
it is neither language nor framework.
 it is runtime environment for executing javascript on the server side.
 node js -> runtime environment
 express js -> framework built on top of nodejs

 features of node js:
 --------------------
 single threaded, asynchronous,

 what is single threaded programming?
 ------------------------------------
 with only one single thread we can execute our tasks.
 with single threaded we can do synchronous programming, asynchronous programming.  (both we can do)


 synchronous programming:
 ------------------------
 serial execution of tasks. (T1 is done then we go to T2. once T2 is done we go to T3. and so on...)
 it is a blocking approach. Tn has to wait until T1, T2...Tn-1 are completed.

 synchronous programming vs single threaded programming:
 -------------------------------------------------------
 synchronous programming -> serial execution
 single threaded programming -> only one thread is responsible for executing tasks.

 multithreaded programming:
 --------------------------
 multiple threads are there to handle the tasks. parallel execution of tasks.

 thread1 handles task1
 thread2 handles task2....

 what is asynchronous programming:
 ----------------------------------
 In node js asynchronous flow can be achieved by single threaded, non-blocking, event driven architecture.
 In javascript asynchronous programming can also be achieved by async-await, promises, web APIs like (settimeout, setinterval).
 Thread: Thread1 (single Threaded).
 tasks: T1, T2, ...

 Thread1 initiates T1. Thread1 don't wait till T1 is completed.
 thread2 initiates T2. 
 .
 .
 .
 and so on.

 if T2 is a small task and it is completed. then T2 emits an event to Thread1. 
 Then Thread1 stops what ever it is doing and it comes to T2 and delivers the result to api. then Thread1 continues its work. 




 How Node is a runtime environment on the serve side? what is v8?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 client side:
 -----------
 every browser contains javascript engine. chrome browser contains v8 engine to execute javascript on the client side.
 server side:
 ------------
 v8 is a javascript engine for execute javascript on server side.


 client side          ------------                 server side 
 chrome browser       -------------                  Node js
